        <p>
            My name is Pranav Kulkaeni. I am currently in my last year at
            <strong>Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology</strong>. I am an aspiring Software Developer and i try my best to contantly upskill myself. I love solving real world problems using tech and thus contribute to something meaningful. I
            recently also started giving competetive programming contests primarily on codechef and codeforces. I was fortunate enough to have done two research internships at <strong>
            S. P. Jain Institute of Management &amp; Research</strong> in the field of
            <strong>Data Analysis &amp; Finance</strong>. I was also very fortunate to intern at <strong>Larsen &amp; Toubro Infotech</strong> during Summer 2021. I am looking for 6 months internships where i can learn and work on some interesting things.
